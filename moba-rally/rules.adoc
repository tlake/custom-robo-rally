`v0.1.4`

toc::[]

== Summary
In this 4v4 (or 3v3, or 2v2, or even 1v1) team game, each team is trying to destroy the opposing team's <<Bases,base>> while defending their own.
Defensive <<Towers,towers>> surround the bases, firing upon enemy robots within range.


== Winning and Scoring
A KDO (Kills/Deaths/Objectives) score is tracked for each robot.

* When a robot kills an enemy robot, increment the killing robot's Kills counter.
    ** If a robot kills an allied robot, the killing robot does not increment its Kills counter.
* When a robot dies, increment the robot's Deaths counter.
* When a robot destroys an <<Objectives,objective>>, increment the robot's Objectives counter.

When one of the two bases is destroyed, the game ends.
The winning team is the team that still has their base, and the winning robot is the robot with the highest KDO score on the winning team.
The KDO score is computed as follows:

`Kills - Deaths + (Objectives * 5)`

In the event of both bases being destroyed simultaneously, the winner is the robot with the highest KDO among all robots.
In the event of a KDO tie, the winner is the robot with the highest Objectives score among tied robots;
then, the robot with the highest Kills score among tied robots;
then, the robot with the lowest Deaths score among tied robots.

=== Credit Where Credit is Due
Credit for kills and objectives is counted for all participants - if a robot or objective would be killed as a direct result of multiple enemy robots' actions, all involved enemy robots would receive credit.

Consider the following examples, where R1 is an enemy robot and R2 and R3 are allied:

* R1 has 9 damage tokens, and R2 and R3 both fire upon R1, each dealing 1 damage.
  R1 dies as a result, and R2 and R3 each increment their Kills score.
* R1 has 8 damage tokens, and R2 and R3 both fire upon R1, each dealing 1 damage.
  R1 dies as a result, and R2 and R3 each increment their Kills score.
  Despite the fact that neither R2 nor R3 could have destroyed R1 on their own, since their combined efforts resulted in R1's death, both allied robots get credit for the kill.
* R1 has 9 damage tokens, and R2 pushes R1 into R3's line of fire
  R3 deals 1 point of damage and destroys R1.
  Both R2 and R3 receive credit for the kill.
* R1 has 9 damage tokens, and R2 pushes R1 into a board laser.
  The board laser destroys R1 on that same register phase, and R2 gets credit for the kill.
* R2 uses the _Radio Control_ option on R1 and R1 moves into a pit or off the board or into a board laser and dies as a result.
  R2 receives credit for the kill if both of the following conditions are true:
    ** The use of _Radio Control_ and R1's destruction both happened during the same round (but not necessarily on the same register phase).
    ** No other robot has interfered with R1's movement between the time that _Radio Control_ was used and the time of R1's destruction.
       (Pushing as a movement action, _<<Pressor Beam>>_, _<<Tractor Beam>>_, _Scrambler_, _<<Mini Howitzer>>_, and another _Radio Control_ all count as interference.)
* R2 uses the _Radio Control_ option on R1 and R1 moves beside a pit.
  R3 then moves into R1, pushing R1 into the pit.
  R3 gets credit for the kill, but R2 does not.
* R2 uses _<<Pressor Beam>>_ or _<<Tractor Beam>>_ to push or pull R1 into a pit or off the board or into a board laser.
  R1 dies, and R2 gets credit for the kill.


== Setup
**Note: This game variant requires components from two sets of the game, and is built upon the 2005 Avalon Hill release.**

The game board is composed of two identical boards ("Vault"), mirrored such that the small two-square blue conveyor belts on each board are facing into the other board.

Each team has a spawning zone behind their base, snugged up such that the spawn zones are only one square removed from the board.

Add a second copy of the _<<High-Power Laser>>_ and _<<Double-Barreled Laser>>_ option cards to the option card deck.

Mark four towers for each base (a base made up of the four wrench-and-hammer tiles in the center of each board), using flags or ten-sided dice.
These towers are situated outside of the cornered walls surrounding each base.
For each corner of each board, count three spaces diagonally inwards and place a tower at the fourth space.


== Game Features

=== Teamwork
Most weapons and attacks do not affect or damage allied robots, and allied robots do not block line of sight for other allied robots.
The cases where this is not so are as follows: 

* _<<Pressor Beam>>_ and _<<Tractor Beam>>_ must affect the first robot (allied or enemy) it could hit. 
* _<<Ramming Gear>>_ still does damage to allied robots.

Consider the following example, where angle brackets indicate the direction in which a robot is facing, robots 1 and 2 are allied, and robots 3 and 4 are allied:

`R1>   R2>   <R3   <R4`

* R1 and R2 will both deal main laser damage to R3, and R3 and R4 will both deal main laser damage to R2.
* If R1 uses _<<High-Power Laser>>_, both R3 and R4 will take main laser damage.
* If R1 uses _<<Pressor Beam>>_ or _<<Tractor Beam>>_, it must affect R2.
* If R3 were instead a tower or a base, both R1 and R2 could use _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ to damage it.
* If R1 uses _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ to attack (and R3 is in range), the weapon would bypass R2 and apply _<<Mini Howitzer,Mini Howitzer's>>_ damage and pushing ability to R3.
* If R1 possesses _<<Ramming Gear>>_ and pushes R2, R2 will take damage as specified from _<<Ramming Gear>>_.
* If R1 uses _Radio Control_ or _Scrambler_, R3 will be affected.

A robot may still push any robot, allied or enemy.

=== The Map
Treat the perimeter of the map as if it were completely enclosed by walls.
There is no way for a robot to fall or be pushed off of the map (except for pits, of course).

=== Spawning
At the start of the game, every robot must choose to spawn on one of the numbered locations on their team's spawning zone.
Thereafter, when a robot respawns, they may choose to do so in their team's spawning zone OR on an unoccupied square in their team's base.
Note that the ability to spawn inside of a base does not mean that the base counts as a spawning zone.

Robots do not fire weapons while inside the spawning zone, and attacks from the board do not extend into spawning zones.
The barrier is one-way; dying and respawning is the only way to re-enter the spawning zone.

=== Objectives
"Objectives" is a term that means "<<Towers>> and/or <<Bases>>."
Objectives cannot be damaged by a robot's regular laser fire.
The _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ option card is the only way to damage a tower or a base, and is a permanent global option.
See the <<Option Cards>> section for rules.

=== Towers
Towers have a range of 3 squares, calculated without diagonals (this creates a diamond-shaped threat zone - see diagram at end of section).
When weapons are fired, a tower selects a target at random from enemy robots in range and deals 3 damage to that robot.
Towers are tall, so walls and other robots don't block a tower's line of sight.

Towers have 10 hit points, and count as impassable terrain that blocks weapons fire and line of sight until destroyed.

When destroyed, a tower deals 5 damage to its friendly base, and each living enemy robot is awarded an option card.

      x

```

=== Bases
Bases are represented by the four wrench squares clustered together in the center of the boards.
These wrenches do not behave as normal.

If a robot ends the round powered-up inside their own base, they heal 2 points of damage.
They may also transfer an option card in their possession to the base, granting that option to the entire allied team.
A base may only have one team option active at any point, and a robot may overwrite the existing team option.
The replaced option card is sent to the graveyard.
Note that the <<Double-Barreled Laser>> option is **ineligible** for installment.

Bases are equipped with a sophisticated ID system, so robots may only enter their own base, not the enemy's.

When an enemy robot would deal damage to a base with its _<<Mini Howitzer>>_, it may instead elect to disrupt the base's option transmitter.
The attack does no damage to the base, and the base's team option card is discarded.

A base has 40 hit points, and the perimeter of the base counts as a wall for purposes of laser fire.

=== Wrench Squares
The four wrenches in the center of each board represent the bases; see the <<Bases>> section for their rules.

The remaining wrenches (two in opposite corners of each board) do not provide healing.
Instead, they grant a robot an option card when the robot ends the fifth register phase powered-up on the tile, provided that the robot is on the enemy board.
A robot does not gain an option card from the wrenches on the board upon which the robot's base also resides.


=== Powering Down
All robots may power down as per the default rules with a few modifications and clarifications, detailed here.

A powered-down robot does not benefit from the healing granted by their base, nor can they install team option cards to the base.

A powered-down robot does gain option cards from wrenches.

A powered-down robot does not benefit from team-broadcast option cards, unless the card specifically states that it affects powered-down robots (such as _Power Down Shield_).

* If _<<Ablative Coat>>_ is being broadcast as a team option, an allied robot does not benefit from it while powered down.
  See the <<Option Cards>> section for further details.

=== Option Cards
There are a few modifications to option cards, detailed here.

Any option card with the _Friendly Fire_ tag means that the option card will damage or otherwise affect robots _regardless_ of team affiliation.
Some examples of how certain option cards may interface with the game can be found in the <<Credit Where Credit is Due>> and <<Teamwork>> sections.


==== Ablative Coat
Operates as normal on an individual basis. When installed into a base as a team option, this card reads as follows:

* Give all living, powered-up allied robots two green tokens.
* As long as this option is broadcast, an allied robot may discard a token instead of taking a point of damage.
* As long as this option is broadcast, an allied robot gains two green tokens upon respawning.
  The respawning robot still begins play with the normal two damage tokens.
* As long as this option is broadcast, an allied robot gains two green tokens upon powering up.
* When a robot dies, remove all green tokens from the robot.
* When a robot powers down, remove all green tokens from the robot.
* When this card is discarded from the base, remove all green tokens from allied robots.
* No robot may ever be in possession of more than two green tokens.

==== Double-Barreled Laser
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* Increases _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ damage by 1.
* **Cannot** be installed into a base as a team option.

==== High-Power Laser
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* Increases _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ range by 1.
* For the purposes of extending the laser through a wall or robot, towers count as walls.

==== Mini Howitzer
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* Is a permanent global option.
* Range of 3 squares.
* Able to damage towers and bases.
* No ammunition tracker.
* With _<<High-Power Laser>>_: increase range by 1.
* With _<<Double-Barreled Laser>>_: increase damage by 1.

==== Pressor Beam
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* _Friendly Fire_

==== Ramming Gear
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* _Friendly Fire_

==== Tractor Beam
Operates as normal, with the following modifications:

* _Friendly Fire_

=== Esoterica and Errata

==== Timing of the Damage Resolution Step
1. Resolve all damage effects simultaneously
    * Robot lasers
    * Board lasers
    * Damage from option cards (like _<<Double-Barreled Laser>>_ or _<<Mini Howitzer>>_)
    * Damage to towers
    * Damage from towers
    * Damage to bases (if a robot has elected to deal damage to a base)
2. Resolve non-damage effects from all weapons in order of register card priority
    * This step includes the use of _<<Mini Howitzer>>_ upon a base to discard a team's option card
3. Remove destroyed robots and objectives

==== Timing of Team Option Installation:
*End of round.*
After everything in Phase 5 has been resolved, conclude Phase 5 and begin the End of Round phase.
At this point, a robot in a base may elect to install an option it's currently carrying into the base.
This decision window closes with the termination of the End of Round phase (in other words, decide before the next round of program cards are dealt).
