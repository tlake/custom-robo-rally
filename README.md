# Robo Rally Game Variants
A collection of Robo Rally rulesets developed with some friends.
These games were originally intended to be played at a rate of one round per day, so some rules may make mention of time limits like "a month" which would sound crazy otherwise.

## American Robonators: Powerball
Robots scramble to pick up balls!
Throw the balls at other robots, or deliver them to pits in order to score points.

## Boulder McBoulderface
Be the last robot standing in an arena featuring a deadly boulder.

## Hack the Gibson
The Gibson (a giant robot) must be stopped, and you need a cool hacker name!
Prove you're the best hacker by hacking the Gibson, destroying the Gibson, and destroying other robots.

## Michael Bay Presents: Roborally
It's every robot for itself in this explosion-packed variant where the board is literally falling out from under you.

## MOBA Rally
In this team game, work to take out the enemy team's robots, towers, and base while defending your own.

## Pacman-Flavored Deathmatch
Eat fruit and power dots until you're last robot standing!
Be careful, though - destroyed robots get to come back as ghosts.

## Presidents and Assholes
Ruin your friendships by bringing money and politics into the game!

## Robo Dodgeball
Relive those terrible high school days with a good old-fashined team-based game of dodgeball!

## Spinbot's Inferno
Break out _all_ your Robo Rally boards and descend through them as if they were the layers of hell itself in this race-to-the-finish variant.

## Tower Defense
Gain power levels, dodge neutral hostile drones, and take out static tower defenses in this game that features a custom map with multiple layers of height.

# DevBot's `!rr` Alias
The Slack channel that we use has an alias feature that allows for the execution of custom code.
This `!rr` alias provides an easy-to-use shorthand method of tracking the events of a game, and now it lives in version control and can be tested.
